Hello,

I run a new Oregon nonprofit called Autism All Grown Up. We focus on supporting autistic adults with unmet support needs.

Our goal is to shore up our current systems so that autistic adults who do not qualify for I/DD support stop falling through the cracks. Finding and supporting this population in autism-appropriate ways will help move them from the margins of society, where they are sometimes barely surviving, to being integrated, accepted, and thriving.

The mission of Autism All Grown Up (AAGU) is to empower autistic adults in Oregon by providing information, resources, and social opportunities tailored to their unique needs. By bridging gaps in the existing infrastructure, we connect and interconnect the adult autistic community and their supporters, facilitate information exchange, and promote collaboration. This ensures that autistic individuals can access the support and opportunities they need to thrive, enhancing their well-being and independence throughout the state.
