Hello,

I run a new Oregon nonprofit called Autism All Grown Up. We focus on support autistic adults who don't qualify for I/DD services and end up falling through the cracks.

Our goal is to shore up our current systems so that autistic adults who do not qualify for I/DD supports stop falling through the cracks. Finding and 
supporting this population in autism-appropriate ways will help move them from the margins of society, where they are sometimes barely surviving, to 
being integrated, accepted, and thriving.
