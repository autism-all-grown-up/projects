Hello,

I lead Autism All Grown Up (AAGU), an Autistic-run nonprofit in Oregon dedicated to empowering the autistic community by addressing systemic gaps and societal barriers. Our mission is to create spaces, systems, and resources that reflect and respect the lived experiences of Autistic adults—especially those who fall through the cracks of existing services.

You can learn more about our organization on our website:

or review our business plan for a detailed overview of our strategy and budget:

Unlike traditional approaches that aim to "help" Autistic people conform to societal expectations, AAGU takes an autism-positive, community-first perspective. We don’t aim to "fix" Autistic individuals; instead, we work to fix or fill the systemic and structural gaps that hinder our community’s ability to thrive. Our initiatives are shaped by our own experiences as Autistic adults and informed by the voices, values, and priorities of our community.

Our unique efforts include:

- Accessible Guides: Developing autism-friendly guides for navigating Medicaid, unemployment, healthcare, and other essential systems.
- Healthcare Training: Equipping healthcare professionals with knowledge and strategies to better serve Autistic patients.
- Community Building: Establishing autism-friendly social and co-working spaces that foster belonging and connection.
- Service Directories: Curating and maintaining up-to-date, searchable directories of local service providers and autism resources.
- Cross-Organization Collaboration: Bridging gaps between organizations to create a unified network of autism-friendly resources.
- Study and Research: Collaborate on efforts to identify and understand the enormous but uncounted population of Autistic adults without intellectual disability.

By collaborating with community partners, we aim to empower Autistic adults and transform how society supports our community. We currently operate under fiscal sponsorship by Cascade Pacific Resource Conservation and Development and are supported by grants and sponsorships.

Thank you,
Ariel

Hello,

I run a new autistic-led Oregon nonprofit called Autism All Grown Up. We focus on supporting autistic adults like ourselves who have unmet needs, especially those who do not qualify for I/DD services.

Systemic change is a long game, so we are leveraging existing infrastructure to help prevent our peers from falling through the cracks because existing programs and social structures don't work for them. We are working with partners such as the [Oregon Commission on Autism Spectrum Disorder](), [Autism Researh and Resources of Oregon](), and [FACT Oregon]() to identify this enormous but uncounted population and support them in autism-appropriate ways will help move them from the margins of society, where they are sometimes barely surviving, to being integrated, accepted, and thriving. Our projects include:

Our goal is to shore up our current systems so that autistic adults who do not qualify for I/DD support stop falling through the cracks. Finding and supporting this population in autism-appropriate ways will help move them from the margins of society, where they are sometimes barely surviving, to being integrated, accepted, and thriving.

The mission of Autism All Grown Up (AAGU) is to empower autistic adults in Oregon by providing information, resources, and social opportunities tailored to their unique needs. By bridging gaps in the existing infrastructure, we connect and interconnect the adult autistic community and their supporters, facilitate information exchange, and promote collaboration. This ensures that autistic individuals can access the support and opportunities they need to thrive, enhancing their well-being and independence throughout the state.

# About Autism All Grown Up
AAGU is a new Oregon nonprofit focusing on the needs of autistic adults who are falling through the cracks because they can't get the supports they need through existing programs and social structures. We currently have four board members, three of whom are late-diagnosed autistic professionals and are seeking more in order to broading our internal capabilities. The fourth current board member as the parent of an autistic adult who founded the organization [Autism Research and Resources of Oregon](https://arrowautism.org). We are also building relationships with partner organizations such as [Autism Community Activity Partners](https://acappdx.org), [FACT Oregon](https://factoregon.org/), and the [Oregon Commission on Autism Spectrum Disorder](https://www.orcommissionasd.org)

We recently received a grant of $25,000 for 2025 and $25,000 for 2026 from the [Matthew Hillman Fisher Foundation](https://matthewhillmanfisherfoundation.org/). We applied for a $20,000 grant specifically for autism-friendly community spaces we are waiting to hear back on. We will be actively applying for more grants and sponsorships in 2025.

AAGU currently functions as a nonprofit under fiscal sponsorship from [Cascade Pacific Resource Conservation and Developmen](https://cascadepacific.org/).

AAGU's work focuses on three key approaches:

## Informational Interfaces
In order to access any program or service, whether that is applying for a job, applying for healthcare, joining a club, or talking to a doctor, a person must first navigate an informational interface. This might be a website, an intake phone call, or an in-person appointment. Because these interfaces are not designed (or trained, in the case of people) for the cognitive processing styles of neurodivergent people, especially autistics, these interfaces create a profound barrier.

One of AAGU's key goals is to create alternative information interfaces. Some will be accessible guides published on our website. Some, we hope, will be used by the organizations that need them. Examples include:

  - Accessing autism evaluations and servcies using the Oregon Health Plan
  - Understanding how state Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities and Vocational Rehabilitation services work and use autistic people can use them.
  - How to improve access to medical care
  - Doctors: What to know about autistic patients

## Autism-Friendly Community Spaces
- Autism-friendly community spaces to gather and work

## Curated, Vetted, and Maintained Information
- Curate and publish usearchable directories of local service providers, with dedicated staff ensuring the information remains fresh and reliable
- Vetted sources of reliable, accurate information about autism.


AAGU is a newly established nonprofit organization based in Oregon, dedicated to addressing the unmet needs of autistic adults who struggle to access the services and resources they require. With a focus on informational interfaces, autism-friendly community spaces, and curated, vetted information, AAGU aims to create meaningful, sustainable change.

Our efforts are supported by a fiscal sponsorship agreement with Cascade Pacific Resource Conservation and Development and an initial grant of $50,000 over two years from the Matthew Hillman Fisher Foundation.
