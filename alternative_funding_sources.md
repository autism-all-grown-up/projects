I have been puzzling over ways to meet the unmet needs of autistic adults I meet, and also how to help ease the transition to adulthood as young adults graduate into the "services cliff". There are a few key problems:

* Few autistic adults meet the requirements for I/DD services despite needing some level of support.  
* Those who are eligible for I/DD services find it very challenging to find DSPs with the skills and understanding to help them.  
* The kinds of things these adults need can be difficult to define, particularly in the context of I/DD supports.

I think it could be possible to use different lesser-used, alternative payment methods through Medicaid that are designed to address the Social Determinants of Health (SDOH). In healthcare lingo, this means supporting health through social wellbeing and can include anything from food or utility assistance to culturally appropriate community engagement.

There are actually quite a few programs of this type:

* Health Related Services (HRS): Non-covered services that are offered as a supplement to covered benefits  
  under Oregonâ€™s Medicaid State Plan to improve care delivery and overall member and community health and  
  well-being.  
* Supporting Health for All through REinvestment (SHARE): Comes from a legislative requirement  
  for CCOs to invest some of their net income or revenues back into their communities.  
* In Lieu Of Services (ILOS): Allows CCOs to offer certain pre-approved, medically appropriate and cost-effective  
  services as an alternative to a covered service. ILOS, which allows for covered services to be provided in  
  alternative settings and/or by non-traditional providers, is intended to promote access to services in culturally  
  responsive ways and reduce hospital, nursing facility and emergency department utilization.  
* Medicaid 1115 Waiver for Health Related Social Needs (HRSN): To cover certain evidence-based services designed to mitigate the negative health impacts of unmet HRSN.  
* Section 1915 home and community-based services (HCBS): Section 1915(i) is a state Medicaid plan option that allows states to use federal Medicaid funding to provide services like Home-Based Habilitation, Behavioral Habilitation, and Psychosocial Rehabilitation. Section 1915(c) is a Medicaid waiver program that allows states to waive certain Medicaid program requirements to provide care for people who might not otherwise be eligible. HCBS waivers expand the types of settings in which people can receive long-term care.  
* Braided Funding Scenarios: where multiple of these funding streams can be used at once--"braided"

None of these are set up for the same level of smooth fee-for-service that I/DD provides for brokerages, agencies, and programs like ACAP. It would take some energy and creativity to develop a model for becoming a service provider able to use these programs. But it does not require special professional licensing like ABA, nursing, or counseling. Moreover, I see this as a way to create well-paying peer-support jobs for autistic people.  
With some effort, I could write a proposal with strong support from the research literature. I'm hoping to inspire existing nonprofits that already has infrastructure in place to explore creating programs to access these funds and fill in the cracks.
