Follow-up:  I received a little more information from ODDS on both safety (AMB serious incident counts by type) and 
assessed needs (AMB formal assessment scores in daily living activities,  unsafe behaviors,  behavior plan enrollment, and 
medical support needs).  unfortunately, while ODDS does have much higher resolution data from their needs assessments,  they 
have not yet (but are working on) structured that data for queries and reports.  needless to say I will stay engaged with my ODDS 
contacts to keep extracting such data as it becomes available.Â 

I'll send what more I have as it comes in.
