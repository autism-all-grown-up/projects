In terms of data and analysis of public services for autism, here's the current path I'm following, FWIW. 

1. Learn as much as possible about autistic Oregonians receiving DD social services via ODHS/ODDS, and their experiences with these services. Key data:
- Application, eligibility assessment & enrollment numbers
- Needs assessments (ADL, IADL, communication, behavior, etc.)
- Service program consumption (residential, employment, enrichment, etc.) 
- Safety levels within service programs (serious incident, abuse data)
- Satisfaction metrics within service programs (complaint and exception data)
- Quality control robustness (provider audits and oversight data)
- Service provider size and growth (licensing and client capacity data)
- Service provider quality of care (qualification and training requirements, staff turnover, etc.)

2. Study the same population's experiences with Medicaid via OHA since over 95% of all of those enrolled in DD Medicaid waiver services in ODHS/ODDS are also enrolled in OHP. Key data:
- Multimorbidity diagnoses statistics
- Service program consumption (OT, PT, SLP, ABA, mental health, etc.) 
- Satisfaction metrics (exception and appeals data)
- Service provider size and growth (licensing and client capacity data)
- Service provider quality of care (qualification and training requirements, turnover, prevalence of private insurance as primary insurer as an indicator of insufficient OHP coverage, prevalence of medical ROIs as an indicator of coordinated care efforts across medical and non-medical service providers, etc.)

3.  Study the extent to which other public services do or do not make intentional accommodations for autistic Oregonians.  Key data:
- Prevalence estimates of autism within the houseless population (OHCS)
- Prevalence estimates of autism within the unemployed population (ODHS/VRS and OED) 
- Prevalence estimates of autism within the incarcerated population (DOC) 
- [I have not fully thought out the target data sets for this step, but I imagine measures of targeted training and accommodations relevant to each service category (housing, employment, corrections) would be the way to go . Perhaps Ariel in his work has a better handle on what information would be useful]

I'm have my mind more fully into this subject next week once I get through some tricky decisions on 2025 health care enrollment for my fam this week.
