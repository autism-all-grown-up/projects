# Overview
Autism All Grown Up (AAGU) is a nonprofit organization intending to use large grants and contracts as our primary funding source. Especially starting out, we also need donations to fund our initial programs and grant-seeking efforts. We want to use a social-media-based crowdfunding campaign. Our organization focuses on Oregon. But the issues we are adressing apply everywhere and because we are creating unique approaches, we think people everywhere might be willing to support us.

# About Autism All Grown Up
AAGU is a new Oregon nonprofit focusing on the needs of autistic adults who are falling through the cracks because they can't get the supports they need through existing programs and social structures. We currently have four board members, three of whom are late-diagnosed autistic professionals and are seeking more in order to broading our internal capabilities. The fourth current board member as the parent of an autistic adult who founded the organization [Autism Research and Resources of Oregon](https://arrowautism.org). We are also building relationships with partner organizations such as [Autism Community Activity Partners](https://acappdx.org), [FACT Oregon](https://factoregon.org/), and the [Oregon Commission on Autism Spectrum Disorder](https://www.orcommissionasd.org)

We recently received a grant of $25,000 for 2025 and $25,000 for 2026 from the [Matthew Hillman Fisher Foundation](https://matthewhillmanfisherfoundation.org/). We applied for a $20,000 grant specifically for autism-friendly community spaces we are waiting to hear back on. We will be actively applying for more grants and sponsorships in 2025.

AAGU currently functions as a nonprofit under fiscal sponsorship from [Cascade Pacific Resource Conservation and Developmen](https://cascadepacific.org/).

AAGU's work focuses on three key approaches:

## Informational Interfaces
In order to access any program or service, whether that is applying for a job, applying for healthcare, joining a club, or talking to a doctor, a person must first navigate an informational interface. This might be a website, an intake phone call, or an in-person appointment. Because these interfaces are not designed (or trained, in the case of people) for the cognitive processing styles of neurodivergent people, especially autistics, these interfaces create a profound barrier.

One of AAGU's key goals is to create alternative information interfaces. Some will be accessible guides published on our website. Some, we hope, will be used by the organizations that need them. Examples include:

  - Accessing autism evaluations and servcies using the Oregon Health Plan
  - Understanding how state Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities and Vocational Rehabilitation services work and use autistic people can use them.
  - How to improve access to medical care
  - Doctors: What to know about autistic patients

## Autism-Friendly Community Spaces
- Autism-friendly community spaces to gather and work

## Curated, Vetted, and Maintained Information
- Curate and publish usearchable directories of local service providers, with dedicated staff ensuring the information remains fresh and reliable
- Vetted sources of reliable, accurate information about autism.

# Deliverables
## Research
Research advertising appropriate to our organization. We will separately provide the contractor details about our organization, priorities, and goals. Since donations will not be our primary source of funding, we are less concerned with how to create a lucrative donation plan, and more interested in a small-scale donation campaign with excellent return on how much we will invest in it. We are also interested in seeking out matching donations from philanthropic individuals and organizations.

## Crowdfunding Plan
- Create a rough plan for a crowdfunding campaign based on the following:
  - GoFundMe site
  - Our Facebook page
  - Meta ecosystem (Facebook, Instagram, Threads)
  - Other social media: X, bluesky, youtube
  - Posts on other FB groups
  - Our [website](https://aagu.org)
  - Newsletter
  - Asking for exposure from other organizations
- The plan should specify how to budget advertising credits, what kinds of posts to make, and where to put most of our effort.
- The plan should also be divided into short-term, middle-term, and long-term phases.
- Create a detailed short-term plan with an initial budget of $800 to be spend over 8 weeks.
- We are interested in the concept of reaching out to philanthropic individuals and organizations who might not typically fund grants we could apply for but would agree to donating multiples of grass-roots donations in specific campaigns.

## Training and Coaching
- Give us a big-picture overview of how social media advertising works, and/or direct us to online resources that can do that.
- Suggest text and graphics to produce.
- Give us feedback and suggestions on what we come up with.

# Implementation
Work with us to implement the short-term plan. We have skilled writing and design capabilities internally. The contractor will coach and guide our efforts.

## Timeline
The timeline of the project will be nine (9) weeks. The first week will be for the contractor to research the project and create a draft fundraising campaign. We would like an initial plan that can be launched quickly within one (1) of starting the contract. We can develop and refine this over the next two (2) weeks. The full funding campaign will run for a total 8 weeks.

## Work Style
Work will be done offsite by the contractor according to their own schedule. Communication will be maintained through our discord server as well as SMS and email. Meetings will be conducted via video chat.

# Review
Review our initial eight (8) week campaign and provide feedback in a written report and meeting during the last week with enough time to decide how to proceed for the next eight (8) weeks.

# Budget
We would like to spend $100/week for eight (8) weeks in our initial campaign.
