# Overview
We are a nonprofit organization intending to use large grants and contracts as our primary funding source. Especially starting out, we also need donations to fund our initial programs and grant-seeking efforts. We want to use a social-media-based crowdfunding campaign. We are also interested in seeking out matching donations from philanthropic individuals and organizations.

# Deliverables
## Research
Research advertising appropriate to our organization. We will separately provide the contractor details about our organization, priorities, and goals.

## Crowdfunding Plan
- Create a rough plan for a crowdfunding campaign based on the following:
  - GoFundMe site
  - Our Facebook page
  - Meta ecosystem (Facebook, Instagram, Threads)
  - Other social media: X, bluesky, youtube
  - Posts on other FB groups
  - Newsletter
  - Asking for exposure from other organizations
- The plan should specify how to budget advertising credits, what kinds of posts to make, and where to put most of our effort.
- The plan should also be divided into short-term, middle-term, and long-term phases.
- Create a detailed short-term plan with an initial budget of $800 to be spend over 8 weeks.

## Implementation
Work with us to implement the short-term plan. We have skilled writing and design capabilities internally. The contractor will coach and guide our efforts.

## Review
Review our initial campaign and provide feedback in a written report and meeting.
