 Attached is an email I sent to health care professionals who are members of the Commission and will be working with me on the draft 
 bill to authorize the continued existence of the Commission.  It outlines our basic case for the Commission.  I did not include in 
 that case the fact that we have only skeletal data on the autism population, but we might want to add that in.  If we get authorized 
 to come up with a strategic plan on autism, it will certainly be featured in our report to the legislature.

The question that was addressed to me concerned primarily academic/clinical research.  I took the occasion to think through our main points
and all the data we have or may need for that purpose.  In doing so, I listed data that is statistical and/or anecdotal, which is where you 
two come in.  Some of that data might be available to you within a few months (the time horizon we'd need it for to make our current case 
to the legislature), but most of it would need to be developed over time.

For example, all of the following data would be useful:  

- how many developmental pediatricians we have now vs. 10 years ago (I can direct 
  you to the folks who would know)  
- the effective reduction in force from flat funding of Regional Inclusive Services since 2007 (the group
  working on the policy option package to revise the funding formula for regional inclusive services would 
  have this info)  
- reductions in special ed budgets (like the ones at Portland Public Schools, where they fired most of their 
  BCBAs to pay for wage concessions to gen ed teachers)
- reductions in the number of special educators and licensed health professionals working in schools since 
  2014 (or another date), 
- the average amount of time spent training special educators on autism in sped degree programs in Oregon, 
  wait lists for diagnoses at the major diagnostic centers, 
- data on the number of patients referred or self-referred to the major diagnostic centers without prior screening, 
- data on referrals for autism evaluations in education made by health care providers without prior screening, 
- useless or questionable diagnostic reports by health care professionals being received by educators (surveying members of the state autism Professional Leadership 
  Team and/or directors of autism programs at regional inclusive services programs would help, and Therese Blanco, a member of our Screening, Identification, and
  Assessment Subcommittee recently completed a PhD dissertation on the quality of health care reports).

I may be overlooking something and you guys may have your own ideas about data to buttress our basic case for the Commission.  But anything you 
could glean along these lines by, say, early January, would be enormously helpful.Â
